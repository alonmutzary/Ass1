# Mail Web App

  

This project is a full-featured email management system with a **Node.js backend**, **React frontend**, and a **C++ Bloom filter server**, fully orchestrated using **Docker Compose**.

  

It includes sending, drafting, labeling, deleting, and spam filtering via a custom URL blacklist server.

## Running the Application with Docker Compose

  

> The app consists of 4 services: `web-frontend`, `web-api`, `bloom-server`, and `tests`.

  

###  Prerequisites

* Port 5588 available (used by the Bloom server)

  

To free the port if it’s in use:

  

```bash

netstat  -aon | findstr  :5588

taskkill  /PID <pid> /F

```

To run frontend only:

  

```bash

cd  frontend/mail-app
